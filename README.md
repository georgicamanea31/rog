Rectangular Oscillation Generator
Designed and implemented a square wave signal generator with the following features:

-Adjustable oscillation frequency in the 15–45 kHz range, with a fixed duty cycle of 0.5.

-Output load of 15 kΩ and adjustable amplitude of 0–3 Vpp, with no DC component.

-Verified operation within the temperature range of 0°–70°C through thermal testing.

-Integrated LED indicator for power supply presence.
